### Introduction

Funnel charts are often used to represent data in different stages of a business process. It’s an important mechanism in Business Intelligence to identify potential problem areas of a process. For example, it’s used to observe the revenue or loss in a sales process for each stage, and displays values that are decreasing progressively. Each stage is illustrated as a percentage of the total of all values.


### Basic Funnel Plot

```python
from plotly import graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(go.Funnel(
    y = ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price", "invoice sent"],
    x = [39, 27.4, 20.6, 11, 2]))

fig.show()
```

### Setting Marker Size and Color
This example uses [textposition](https://plot.ly/python/reference/#scatter-textposition) and [textinfo](https://plot.ly/python/reference/#funnel-textinfo) to determine information apears on the graph, and shows how to customize the bars.

```python
from plotly import graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(go.Funnel(
    y = ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price", "Finalized"],
    x = [39, 27.4, 20.6, 11, 2],
    textposition = "inside",
    textinfo = "value+percent initial",
    opacity = 0.65, marker = {"color": ["deepskyblue", "lightsalmon", "tan", "teal", "silver"],
    "line": {"width": [4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1], "color": ["wheat", "wheat", "blue", "wheat", "wheat"]}},
    connector = {"line": {"color": "royalblue", "dash": "dot", "width": 3}})
    )

fig.show()
```

### Stacked Funnel Plot

```python
from plotly import graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Funnel(
    name = 'Montreal',
    y = ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price"],
    x = [120, 60, 30, 20],
    textinfo = "value+percent initial"))

fig.add_trace(go.Funnel(
    name = 'Toronto',
    orientation = "h",
    y = ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price", "invoice sent"],
    x = [100, 60, 40, 30, 20],
    textposition = "inside",
    textinfo = "value+percent previous"))

fig.add_trace(go.Funnel(
    name = 'Vancouver',
    orientation = "h",
    y = ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Potential customers", "Requested price", "invoice sent", "Finalized"],
    x = [90, 70, 50, 30, 10, 5],
    textposition = "outside",
    textinfo = "value+percent total"))

fig.show()
```

#### Basic Area Funnel Plot

```python
from plotly import graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(go.Funnelarea(
    text = ["The 1st","The 2nd", "The 3rd", "The 4th", "The 5th"],
    values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    ))
fig.show()
```

#### Set Marker Size and Color in Area Funnel Plots

```python
from plotly import graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure(go.Funnelarea(
      values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], text = ["The 1st","The 2nd", "The 3rd", "The 4th", "The 5th"],
      marker = {"colors": ["deepskyblue", "lightsalmon", "tan", "teal", "silver"],
                "line": {"color": ["wheat", "wheat", "blue", "wheat", "wheat"], "width": [0, 1, 5, 0, 4]}},
      textfont = {"family": "Old Standard TT, serif", "size": 13, "color": "black"}, opacity = 0.65))
fig.show()
```

#### Multiple Area Funnels


```python
from plotly import graph_objects as go

fig = go.Figure()

fig.add_trace(go.Funnelarea(
    scalegroup = "first", values = [500, 450, 340, 230, 220, 110], textinfo = "value",
    title = {"position": "top center", "text": "Sales for Sale Person A in U.S."},
    domain = {"x": [0, 0.5], "y": [0, 0.5]}))

fig.add_trace(go.Funnelarea(
    scalegroup = "first", values = [600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100], textinfo = "value",
    title = {"position": "top center", "text": "Sales of Sale Person B in Canada"},
    domain = {"x": [0, 0.5], "y": [0.55, 1]}))

fig.add_trace(go.Funnelarea(
    scalegroup = "second", values = [510, 480, 440, 330, 220, 100], textinfo = "value",
    title = {"position": "top left", "text": "Sales of Sale Person A in Canada"},
    domain = {"x": [0.55, 1], "y": [0, 0.5]}))

fig.add_trace(go.Funnelarea(
            scalegroup = "second", values = [360, 250, 240, 130, 120, 60],
            textinfo = "value", title = {"position": "top left", "text": "Sales of Sale Person B in U.S."},
            domain = {"x": [0.55, 1], "y": [0.55, 1]}))

fig.update_layout(
            margin = {"l": 200, "r": 200}, shapes = [
            {"x0": 0, "x1": 0.5, "y0": 0, "y1": 0.5},
            {"x0": 0, "x1": 0.5, "y0": 0.55, "y1": 1},
            {"x0": 0.55, "x1": 1, "y0": 0, "y1": 0.5},
            {"x0": 0.55, "x1": 1, "y0": 0.55, "y1": 1}])

fig.show()
```
